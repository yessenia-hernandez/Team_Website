    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I was born in Greenbrae, California on September 6th of 1999. Some of my hoobies include playing the piano and guitar, reading, and dancing. One goal that I currently have is going to college/university after I graduate. One interesting thing about me is that I actually enjoy doing math!</p>
      <h1>Favorite Quote</h1>
