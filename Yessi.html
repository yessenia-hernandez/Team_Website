    <th>Background:<p>I was born on Febuary 7, 2000. <br>I was bron in Tetla de la Solidaridad which is a municipality<br>  in Tlaxcala in south-eastern Mexico. My family is quite small; I'm an only child, <br> so its just my parents and I. About a year ago however, I would have added my dog <br> (see picture above) to that list too, but after we moving houses<br> we had to give him away. The good thing is, the Marin Human Society was <br> able to find him a home <br> the day after we dropped him off; crazy right? </th>

      <th>.......... </th>
    <th>Goals:<p>My greatest goal since the age of 9 has been to <br> become a lawyer that specializes in prosecution. <br> Dinner at my house always came with a side of Tv news since I<br>  can last remember. So that means that at an early age I was exposed to some of<br> the darker side of the human race. I would always see injustices made to the same face, undocumented immigrants, women, and <br> children; people who I identified/ would identify with. So after realizing that I couldnâ€™t cure the<br>  evil in the world with my tone-deaf voice, I decided to look into other options.<br>  That ended with me deciding to be a lawyer
