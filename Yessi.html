         <div class="col-sm-4"><center>Background: <br> I was born on Febuary 7, 2000. I was bron in Tetla de la Solidaridad which is a municipality in Tlaxcala in south-eastern Mexico. My family is quite small; I'm an only child, so its just my parents and I. About a year ago however, I would have added my dog (see picture above) to that list too, but after we moving houses we had to give him away. The good thing is, the Marin Human Society was able to find him a home the day after we dropped him off; crazy right?</div></center>

         <div class="col-sm-4"><center>Goals:<br> My greatest goal since the age of 9 has been to <br> become a lawyer that specializes in prosecution. Dinner at my house always came with a side of Tv news since I can last remember. So that means that at an early age I was exposed to some of the darker side of the human race. I would always see injustices made to the same face, undocumented immigrants, women, and children; people who I identified/ would identify with. So after realizing that I couldnâ€™t cure the evil in the world with my tone-deaf voice, I decided to look into other options. That ended with me deciding to be a lawyer</div></center>
